## Introduction

Welcome to the MyCrumbs UI Kit quickstart guide. This guide will help you set up and start using MyCrumbs UI Kit in your project.

## Installation

First, you need to install the MyCrumbs UI Kit package. You can do this using npm or yarn.

```
npm install mycrumbs-uikit
```
or
```
yarn add mycrumbs-uikit
```

## Setup

To use MyCrumbs UI Kit, you need to wrap your application with the `MyCrumbsProvider`. This ensures that all components have access to the theme and other configurations.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { MyCrumbsProvider } from 'mycrumbs-uikit';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyCrumbsProvider>
    <App />
  </MyCrumbsProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Usage

Now you can start using the components provided by MyCrumbs UI Kit. Here is an example of how to use a button component.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'mycrumbs-uikit';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');

  };

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## Customization

MyCrumbs UI Kit allows you to customize the theme to match your brand. You can do this by passing a custom theme to the `MyCrumbsProvider`.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { MyCrumbsProvider, createTheme } from 'mycrumbs-uikit';
import App from './App';

const customTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: '#3b82f6',
    secondary: '#bfdbfe',
  },
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyCrumbsProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <App />
  </MyCrumbsProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
